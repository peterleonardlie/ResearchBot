The best Greek food I’ve had in Australia is not in Melbourne, but at Hellenika in Gold Coast, Queensland. When my family moved from Melbourne to the United States in the early 1990s, we quickly came to the conclusion that the main difference in the two nations’ cooking was our prodigious use of lemon juice and olive oil.'"
